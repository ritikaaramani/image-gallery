## üöÄ Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the entire application locally.

### 1. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory to set up the client-side application.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
The frontend will be available at:
http://localhost:3000

2. Backend Setup
Set up the backend API, which powers the image and user management.

bash
Copy code
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
The backend API will run at:
http://localhost:8000

3. AI Tools Setup
Configure the AI-powered image generation service to expand your gallery.

bash
Copy code
cd ai-tools
i. Create a .env File
Create a .env file and populate it with environment variables. Do not commit real tokens.

env
Copy code
# Backend Base URL (frontend uses this to talk to backend)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Redis connection (used by worker + backend)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Database connection (default is SQLite for local dev)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./backend/app.db

# Replicate API token (required for image generation)
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE>
Replace <YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE> with your actual Replicate API token. Never commit it to GitHub.

ii. Run Everything with Docker
From inside the project directory, build the Docker images and start all services:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev:all
This command will start the frontend, backend, worker, Redis, and database services.

iii. Open the App
Once running, access the application locally:

Frontend (Next.js): http://localhost:3000

Backend (FastAPI): http://localhost:8000/docs

Redis: running on localhost:6379

4. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend folder for secrets and configurations:

env
Copy code
# Example for backend
DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_DATABASE_URL>
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE>
Never commit secrets or API tokens to GitHub.
